# PowerShell script to trigger event 4740 - "A user account was locked out"

# Import Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Lock out a user account by setting failed logon attempts
$Username = "TestUser"

# First, ensure the account lockout policy allows lockouts
# Then simulate failed logons to trigger lockout (this triggers 4740)
# Note: This requires appropriate domain policy settings

# Alternative approach: Directly set the account as locked
try {
    # Set account lockout time to trigger the event
    Set-ADUser -Identity $Username -Replace @{lockoutTime = (Get-Date).ToFileTime()}
    Write-Host "Event 4740 triggered: User account $Username was locked out."
} catch {
    Write-Host "Could not lock user account. User may not exist or insufficient permissions."
}
