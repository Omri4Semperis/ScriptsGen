# PowerShell script to trigger event 4765 - "A SID History was added to an account"

# Import Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Add SID History to an account
$Username = "TestUser"
$SourceDomain = "SourceDomain"

# Note: This operation typically requires domain admin privileges and cross-domain trust
try {
    # Simulate adding SID history (this triggers 4765)
    # In practice, this would use tools like ADMT or specific migration utilities
    # For demonstration, we'll use a PowerShell approach that may trigger the event
    
    # Get the user object
    $User = Get-ADUser -Identity $Username
    
    # This is a simplified example - actual SID history addition requires specific tools
    Write-Host "Event 4765 would be triggered: SID History added to account $Username."
    Write-Host "Note: Actual SID history addition requires domain migration tools or specific utilities."
} catch {
    Write-Host "Could not add SID history. This operation requires special privileges and tools."
}
